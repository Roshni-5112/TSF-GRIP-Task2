# TSF-GRIP-Task2

# The Sparks Foundation Internship Task 2

## Task Description:
From the given Iris dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually using unsupervised machine learning, specifically K-means clustering.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this task is the Iris dataset. It is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and contains samples of iris flowers, with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Approach:
- **Machine Learning Model:** Unsupervised learning
- **Algorithm:** K-means clustering
- **Objective:** Determine the optimal number of clusters in the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the clusters to gain insights into the data distribution.

## Steps:
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Use K-means clustering algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters.
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the Elbow method.
4. Apply K-means clustering with the determined number of clusters.
6. Visualize the clusters to represent them visually.
